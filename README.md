# Decentralized Lottery DApp 🎰

This project is a decentralized lottery smart contract built using Solidity. It utilizes **Chainlink VRF** for secure randomness and **Chainlink Automation (Keepers)** to automate winner selection at predefined intervals.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Fully decentralized lottery system
- 🔒 Verifiable randomness via Chainlink VRF
- ⏱️ Automated execution using Chainlink Keepers
- 💸 Entrance fee configuration
- 📜 Smart contract written in Solidity
- 🔧 Deployable with Hardhat

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Solidity
- Hardhat
- Chainlink VRF v2
- Chainlink Automation (Keepers)
- Ethers.js
- JavaScript (deployment scripts)
